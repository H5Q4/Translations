## Actual Talk Review

- M: Hey, Rachel, how are you?
- W: I'm good but I'm a bit nervous.
- M: Why?
- W: Because *I'm starting a new company* in a couple of days, but I don't really know how to introduce myself to a new group of people.
- M: *The first day of* a new company is [nerve-racking](), right? *You meet so many new faces* and they all know each other as well. That's even worse. But there are some things you should do *on your first day*.
- W: I'd love some advice.
- M: OK, A *firm handshake*, *that is key*, *to project confidence*, but not too hard, you don't want to hurt the other person, but not too [flimsy]() as well. I hate *a wet flimsy handshake*. So if you are feeling nervous and sweaty, perhaps *give your hand a wipe* as well.
- W: Oh, like a handkerchief in my pocket or something.
- M: Yeah, absolutely. If you don' t have that, just go to the back of your skirt or trousers.
- W: No, that's a great idea.
- M: Because when it's a sweaty hand...
- W: [Clammy]() hands.
- M: They are going to call you *clammy hands* at the company.
- W: Alright, so a firm handshake is really important.
- M: And then *eye contact* as well.
- M: And a big smile, I think that always helps, it makes people feel much more comfortable.
- W: Yeah, that's true, that will definitely [leave a great first impression]().
- M: As long as you don't *have something stuck in your teeth*. Again, check.
- W: Oh no, I'll have to get a mirror and check my teeth. *That's for sure*.  Alright so you are saying a firm handshake is important, good eye contact, those show that I'm confident and then a friendly smile will show that I'm *at ease* and that I'm *comfortable with my surroundings*.
- M: Sure, and then maybe the last thing, *remember other people's names*.
- W: Oh, right!
- M: And when you say your name as well, *project it loudly* so they remember you.
- W: But you know, there are so many people that I have to meet. How do I remember all their names?
- M: I think *writing it down* as soon as you can, *the earliest possible opportunity*. But I think that's about it. And I think you'll be fine, Rachel.
- W: You think so? Alright, well I *can't wait to use that advice* on my first day at my new company.
- M: [Fingers crossed]()!
- W: Thank you.
